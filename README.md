Machine Learning Foundations: From Regression to Neural NetworksThis repository documents the implementation and comparison of fundamental Supervised Learning algorithms. It serves as a code-first exploration of how different models handle linear and non-linear patterns.🧠 Algorithms Implemented1. Linear & Logistic RegressionLinear Regression: Modeled the relationship between House Prices and Square Footage. Validated assumptions like linearity and homoscedasticity.Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification (Pass/Fail) based on study hours. visualized the Sigmoid Function to interpret probability thresholds.2. Non-Linear Models (KNN & Decision Trees)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Implemented a distance-based classifier. Tuned the hyperparameter $k$ to balance overfitting and underfitting.Decision Trees: Compared against Logistic Regression. Found that Trees captured non-linear relationships better but were more prone to overfitting without pruning.3. Model Comparison (Breast Cancer Dataset)Benchmarking: Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees on the same dataset.Metrics: Evaluated using Recall (crucial for medical diagnosis to avoid false negatives) alongside Accuracy and F1-Score.4. Intro to Deep LearningPyTorch Basics: Transitioned from Scikit-Learn to PyTorch, learning tensor manipulation and building a simple Feed-Forward Neural Network (DNN) for heart failure prediction.🛠️ Libraries UsedScikit-Learn: For all classical ML models and metrics.PyTorch: For neural network implementation.Matplotlib/Seaborn: For decision boundary visualization.
